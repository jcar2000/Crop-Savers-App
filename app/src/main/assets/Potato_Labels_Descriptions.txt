Early Blight;Early blight of potato is a common disease found in most potato growing regions. The disease is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani, which can also afflict tomatoes and other members of the potato family. \nAlthough not a terminal disease, severe infections can be fairly detrimental. In contrast to its name, early blight rarely develops early; it actually usually affects mature foliage rather than young leaves. \nymptoms first occur on the lower or oldest leaves of the plant. Dark, brown spots appear on this older foliage and, as the disease progresses, enlarge, taking on an angular shape. These lesions often look like a target and, in fact, the disease is sometimes referred to as target spot.;https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/potato/potato-early-blight-treatment.htm
Late Blight;Late blight of potatoes is caused by the pathogen Phytophthora infestans. Primarily a disease of potatoes and tomatoes, late blight may affect other members of the Solanaceae family as well. This fungal disease is fostered by periods of cool, wet weather. Infected plants may be killed off within a couple of weeks from infection. \nInitial symptoms of late blight include purplish-brown lesions on the surface of the potatoes. When inspected further by cutting into the tuber, reddish-brown dry rot can be observed.;https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/potato/managing-potatoes-with-late-blight.htm
