Black Rot;Black rot of grapes is a fungal disease that persists in grapevines for many years without treatment. \nThe earliest signs of disease appear as yellow circular lesions on young leaves. As these lesions spread, they brown and sprout black fungal fruiting bodies that look similar to grains of pepper. With advancing disease, lesions may girdle the petiole of individual leaves, killing them. \nThe best time to treat black rot of grapes is between bud break until about four weeks after bloom, treating outside of this window is likely to end in frustration. However, if you want to try, captan and myclobutanil are the fungicides of choice.;https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/fruits/grapes/black-rot-grape-treatment.htm
Esca (Black Measles);Esca is part of a complex of "trunk diseases" including, Botryosphaeria dieback, Eutypa dieback, and Phomopsis dieback. \nThe foliar symptom of Esca is an interveinal "striping". The "stripes", which start out as dark red in red cultivars and yellow in white cultivars, dry and become necrotic. \nSymptomatic leaves can dry completely and drop prematurely. On berries, small, round, dark spots each bordered by a brown-purple ring, may occur. \nIn severely affected vines, the berries often crack and dry or are subject to spoilage. Symptomatic fruit is found only on shoots with symptomatic leaves, but you can find shoots with symptomatic leaves and no symptomatic fruit.;https://www2.ipm.ucanr.edu/agriculture/grape/Esca-Black-Measles/
Leaf Blight (Isariopsis Leaf Spot);Isariopsis is a fungal disease caused by Pseudocercospora vitis \nOn leaf surface there will be lesions which are irregularly shaped (2 to 25 mm in diameter). Initially lesions are dull red to brown in color and turn black later. If the disease is severe these lesions may coalesce. \nOn berries we can see symptoms similar to black rot but the entire clusters will collapse.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261219414001598
