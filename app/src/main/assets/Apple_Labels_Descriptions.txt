Apple Scab;Apple scab is a common fungal disease affecting the leaves and fruit to the point where the tree loses its leaves, and the apples are so blemished that they become unfit for eating. \nThe apple scab fungus thrives in areas with lots of rain and high humidity, and during a warm, wet spring. Because there is no treatment for infected trees, early identification and prevention are crucial for its control.\n;test
Black Rot;Black rot is a disease of apples that infects fruit, leaves, and bark caused by the fungus Botryosphaeria obtusa. \nFruit infection is the most destructive form of this pathogen and begins with infected flowers before fruits expand. When fruits are tiny and green, youâ€™ll notice red flecks or purplish pimples that enlarge as the fruit does. \nMature fruit lesions take on a bulls-eye appearance, with bands of brown and black areas expanding outward from a central point in each lesion.;https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/fruits/apples/black-rot-on-apple-trees.htm
