Bacterial Spot;Bacterial spot is among the most devastating tomato diseases due to its ability to spread quickly and its resistance to control methods. Caused by four species of Xanthomonas, bacterial spot occurs all over the world wherever tomatoes are cultivated. \nThe disease causes leaf and fruit spots as well as defoliation, which leads to sun-scalded fruit and crop loss. \nIt’s important not to eat fruit or vegetables that are infected with bacterial spot. Although people can’t catch bacterial spot, the lesions provide an opening for all kinds of pathogens that we can catch to enter the produce.;https://www.gardeningchannel.com/tomato-diseases-how-to-fight-bacterial-spot/
Early Blight;Early blight is a common tomato disease caused by the fungus Alternaria solani. It can affect almost all parts of the tomato plants, including the leaves, stems, and fruits. The plants may not die, but they will be weakened and will set fewer tomatoes than normal. \nEarly blight generally attacks older plants, but it can also occur on seedlings. Stressed plants or plants in poor health are especially susceptible \nEarly blight is a difficult enough disease to deal with, but don't confuse it with the much more problematic late blight that can quickly kill tomato plants and spread for miles.;https://www.thespruce.com/early-blight-on-tomato-plants-1402973
Late Blight;Late blight tomato disease is the rarest of the blights that affect both tomatoes and potatoes, but it is also the most destructive. \nOn tomatoes, the fungus-like organism can destroy a crop within days if conditions are right. Vigilant observation and pre-treatment are the only defenses against late tomato blight. \nThe tiny lesions of late tomato blight are hard to spot and sometimes go unnoticed. The late blight symptoms become more obvious when the area around the lesions appears water soaked or bruised and turns grey-green or yellowed.;https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/tomato/tomato-late-blight.htm
Leaf Mold;Leaf mold of tomato is caused by pathogen Passalora fulva. It is found throughout the world, predominantly on tomatoes grown where the relative humidity is high, particularly in plastic greenhouses. \nSymptoms start as pale green to yellowish spots on upper leaf surfaces that turn a bright yellow. The spots merge as the disease progresses and the foliage then dies. Infected leaves curl, wither, and often drop from the plant. \nFlowers, stems, and fruit may be infected, although usually only leaf tissue is affected. When the disease does manifest on the fruit, tomatoes with leaf mold become dark in color, leathery, and rot at the stem end.;https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/tomato/managing-tomato-leaf-mold.htm
Septoria Leaf Spot;Septoria leaf canker primarily affects tomato plants and members of its family. It is a leaf spot disease that is first evident on the oldest leaves of the plants. \nSeptoria on tomato leaves manifests as water spots that are 1/16 to 1/4 inch (2-6 mm.) wide. As the spots mature, they have brown edges and lighter tan centers and become septoria leaf cankers. A magnifying glass would confirm the presence of small black fruiting bodies in the center of the spots. These fruiting bodies will ripen and explode and spread more fungal spores. \nSeptoria leaf blotch or spot causes tomato plants to decline in vigor. The septoria leaf cankers cause so much stress to the leaves that they fall off. The lack of foliage will diminish the health of the tomato;https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/tomato/septoria-leaf-spot.htm
Two-Spotted Spider Mites;Two-Spotted Spider Mites are mites with the scientific name of Tetranychus urticae that infest hundreds of different plant species. \nIf you see two-spotted spider mite damage on your plants, they probably have mites in all stages of development. Generations tend to overlap. In hot dry weather, the infestations are particularly severe and control of two-spotted mites becomes important.;https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/plant-problems/pests/insects/two-spotted-spider-mite-control.htm
Target Spot;Target spot on tomato fruit is difficult to control because the spores, which survive on plant refuse in the soil, are carried over from season to season. \nIt is also difficult to recognize in the early stages, as the disease resembles several other fungal diseases of tomatoes. \nHowever, as diseased tomatoes ripen and turn from green to red, the fruit displays circular spots with concentric, target-like rings and a velvety black, fungal lesions in the center. The “targets” become pitted and larger as the tomato matures.;https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/tomato/target-spot-on-tomatoes.htm
Yellow Leaf Curl Virus;Tomato yellow leaf curl is a disease of tomato caused by Tomato yellow leaf curl virus. \nInfected tomato plants initially show stunted and erect or upright plant growth; plants infected at an early stage of growth will show severe stunting. However, the most diagnostic symptoms are those in leaves. \nLeaves of infected plants are small and curl upward; and show strong crumpling and interveinal and marginal yellowing. The internodes of infected plants become shortened and, together with the stunted growth, plants often take on a bushy appearance. \nFruit production is dramatically reduced, particularly when plants are infected at an early age, and it is not uncommon for losses of 100% to be experienced in fields with heavily infected plants.;https://www2.ipm.ucanr.edu/agriculture/tomato/tomato-yellow-leaf-curl/
Mosaic Virus;Tomato mosaic virus is a serious and extremely contagious disease. It is also hard to identify, with symptoms varying wildly depending upon the variety and age of the infected plant, the strain of the virus, and environmental conditions. \nTomato mosaic virus symptoms can be found at any stage of growth and all parts of the plant may be infected. They are often seen as a general mottling or mosaic appearance on foliage. When the plant is severely affected, leaves may look akin to ferns with raised dark green regions. \nInfected plants may have a severe reduction in fruit set and those that do set may be dotted with yellow blotches and necrotic spots while the interior of the fruit is brown.;https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/tomato/managing-tomato-mosaic-virus.htm
