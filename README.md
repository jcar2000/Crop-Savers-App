# **Crop Savers**

An android based disease detection system for crop leaves using image classification techniques.

Trained on 60,000 images, the app is able to accurately make predictions for the types of diseases that an individual crop leaf may have as well as give important information about them such as ways to mitigate or manage the dieseases to reduce further crop destruction.


------------

The app has the ability to make predictions for 9 different crop species as can be seen in the species select screen in the below graphic and contains 9 separately trained mobileNetv2 models that represent each species respectively.
